            |  Flammable materials pose significant risks to businesses, and these risks must be mitigated to optimize institutional safety standards and minimize the risk of process interruptions and damage to property, inventory, and other assets. Storage vessels, pipes, and other elements that come in close contact with volatile chemicals and combustible agents should be treated with fire-retardant and flame-resistant coatings to guard against fire danger.

            |  Cementitious fireproofing, or spray fireproofing, is a technique that uses a coating or protection material that is applied to specific points of your building. These need to be understood and distributed correctly, in an aesthetically pleasing, legally delegated manner. Understanding current health and environmental trends, are important to properly distributing and applying cementitious fireproofing. This method is designed to protect your property for generations. Cementitious fireproofing involves applying a compound using various spraying and or ordnance delivery devices. These will be applied to the vulnerable points and sections of your building and or property. This done in the correct fashion, will protect your building and the lives of those who dwell within it. Our product will also hinder fire from spreading, providing a protective barrier between the construction materials. Our technicians eliminate any potential fire hazard risks.

            |  Epoxy-based intumescent passive fire protection (PFP) coatings offer highly durable and corrosion-resistant solutions for surfaces in need of flame-resistant treatments. While cementitious fireproof coatings are sometimes used in place of epoxy-based treatments, experts generally recommend epoxies due to their superior life cycle cost and ease of maintenance. Cementitious treatments are typically applied to non-steel materials, such as wood and masonry, while epoxies are the best choice for steel, metals, and alloys. The underlying purpose of industrial epoxy fireproofing is to prevent the treated surface from reaching a critical core temperature when exposed to flames. Though your specific needs may vary according to your organizational fire risk reduction plan, epoxy-fireproofing treatments are recommended for all primary structural components that come in contact with flammable chemicals and agents.
