                | Many construction contractors abide by a "make a hole, fill a hole" rule. The contractor who creates the hole fills the whole. In some circumstances, this approach may be enough. Still, often, the fire-stopping materials contractors have on hand is not the best-suited materials for the job. A company like Titan Group employs qualified artisans that specialize in fire-stopping. We also keep a strong relationship with our high-quality product suppliers.

                | For the professionals at Titan Group, the installation philosophy is simple - we seal tight and ventilate right. It's because sealing tight without ventilating is doing only half the job, which is why we make sure to eliminate air leakage AND ensure ventilation. When the building is ventilated correctly, everything works in balance - energy efficiency is improved. Indoor air circulation and air quality are enhanced, and HVAC performance is optimized.
